## Procedures
A procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be executed together as a single unit.
It is used to perform an operation or a series of operations on the database.
Procedures can accept parameters, perform calculations, update data, and return results.
They provide procedural programming capabilities within the database system, allowing for conditional logic and looping.
